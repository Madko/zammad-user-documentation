"Without groups, all ten agents can see (and respond to) every single "
"ticket that comes in, regardless of which department it‚Äôs for. This isn‚Äôt"
" problematic *per se,* but it does lead to a lot of unnecessary clutter "
"in the :doc:`overviews menu </basics/find-ticket>`. (It can be much worse"
